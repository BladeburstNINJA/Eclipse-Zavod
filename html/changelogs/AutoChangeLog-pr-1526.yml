changes:
  - rscadd: Adds trichloramine, a flammable gas that's also an oxidiser.
  - rscadd: Adds liquid trichloramine, a reagent that's dangerous to make.
  - rscadd: Adds monochloramine, which essentially the same as trichloramine but not
      flammable (intended for planet gas use)
  - rscadd: Adds ausgiftrol, a powerful antivenin that's 4 times as effective at purging
      roach and spider venom compared to dylovene, but is only 75% as effective of
      an antitoxin.

changes:
  - rscdel: Removed Captain's Spare from Captain's Stash
  - bugfix: Changed references from station to ship in most cases. I hope.
  - bugfix: Properly assigned things that were still NanoTheology either NanoTrasen
      or Mekhane Armory as needed.
  - bugfix: Changed AI laws slightly to define the crew of the NEV Northern Light
      instead of NanoTrasen personnel where needed.
  - bugfix: Changed the lore screen to show our lore instead of Eris. Now you can
      properly revel in your achievements. Horay!

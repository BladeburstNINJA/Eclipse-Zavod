changes:
  - tweak: Added a variable to projectiles to determine if it will explode welderfuel
      tanks or Benzin roaches.
  - balance: Benzin roaches no longer explode from blunt-force trauma.
  - balance: Benzin roaches now leak welder fuel when killed.
  - balance: Benzin roaches now gib when exploded. You can now detonate Benzin roaches
      after their death if you so desire. (Why anyone would WANT to do that, is beyond
      me.)
  - balance: Buffed Benzin health up to 25 to counteract the above.
  - balance: Welderfuel tanks no longer explode if shot at by bullets that shouldn't
      explode them; they will instead leak.
